    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

We should empower the\\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green revolution. Meeting the\\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence that the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries particularly for value addition.\\n\\nDefeat the problems and succeed\\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience.\\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appointments, a wheelchair was\\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands\\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mind. He introduced himself\\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him how this had\\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from birth. He thanked God, his parents,\\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and help. I asked him, what\\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in front\\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraja’s pancha ratna kriti\\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched.\\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music\\ncould blossom in this person with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, academics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of course, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtrapati Bhavan art theatre.\\n\\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership\\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of\\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the devastating earthquake in\\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the\\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of\\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged.\\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of\\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations\\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating\\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the problem rather than\\nallowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe loss due to the earthquake, the children and the members of the village participated in the relief operation with the Armed Forces bravely and were smiling when I went to meet them. They all wanted to return to their normal life as quickly as possible. The efforts of Armed Forces and the civil society have helped in accelerating the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction. This spirit should be carried forward to combat natural calamities through synergy in relief operations.\\n\\nConnectivity for societal transformation\\nLet me share an experience about technology application for improving societal\\ntransformation. The experience of using the information and communication technology\\nfor improving societal transformation was visible during the last visit of President of\\nFinland to India in October 2006. I had the privilege of hosting a discussion session\\nwith the President of Finland at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He shared with us the model of\\nuniversal health care system of Finland. He said that in Finland, through tele-medicine\\napproach, each patient has a direct connectivity with the medical center with the help of\\ntelemedicine technology. I felt that our country has a unique opportunity to adopt\\ninformation technology tools like mobile phones and low cost laptops and internet\\ntechnology to improve the health care services to the citizens in remote and far-flung\\nareas. I have seen similar projects in operation like “tele-medicine project” at some of the\\nvillages, particularly at Bhathra Village of Chhattisgarh, where the villagers are now able\\nto interact with specialists for treatment of patients. The experience in applying the\\ntechnology to rural health care systems is being discussed in many States and is being\\nreplicated.\\n\\nDefending the nation: Our pride\\nDuring my tenure, I had the opportunity to interact with the Armed Forces and\\nParamveer and Mahavir Chakra awardees. These war heroes have given their supreme\\nsacrifices to protect the unity, integrity and sovereignty of our nation. The courage,\\nvalor and patriotism of these soldiers must be a source of inspiration to every Indian.\\nThe bravery of our armed forces, which exhibited in protecting the nation, is unparalleled\\nand praiseworthy. The experience of meeting these national heroes was a very enriching\\nand humbling experience.\\n\\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020\\nI would like to close by talking about the youth movement. During the last five years, I\\nhave met the youth and students of all categories from all parts of the country. I have\\nfound their enthusiasm, courage, innovation and creativity in building a Developed India\\nby the year 2020. It is our primary responsibility to facilitate their efforts and to\\ncontinuously inspire and involve them in our journey of nation building. The youth\\nmovement should focus on improving the quality of education, ensuring better health\\ncare, strengthening of democratic institutions and empowering people to fight\\ncorruption. I am confident that with the collective efforts of the youth, the nation will\\nachieve the goal of Developed India 2020.\\n\\nI thank all of you for the support, encouragement and cooperation during my tenure.\\nI shall cherish these moments of my life forever and will always be available for any\\nsupport or guidance you may need.\\n\\nThank you.'"
